The transition between the tampered area and the original image is abrupt, indicating that the giraffe was inserted into the scene.\n\n2. **Lighting Inconsistency**:\n - The lighting on the giraffe does not match the lighting conditions of the rest of the scene. The shadows and highlights on the giraffe do not align with the direction and intensity of the light source evident in the rest of the image.\n\n3. **Perspective Relationships**:\n - The perspective of the giraffe is slightly off compared to the other elements in the scene. The size and angle of the giraffe do not align with the vanishing points and horizon lines, suggesting that it was added without proper alignment.\n\n# Low-Level Pixel Statistics\n\n1. **Noise Inconsistency**:\n - The tampered region exhibits different noise characteristics compared to the rest of the image. The noise pattern in the tampered area is smoother and less uniform, indicating that it has been altered from another source.\n\n2. **Color Discrepancy**:\n - There is a noticeable difference in color tones between the tampered region and the surrounding areas.
