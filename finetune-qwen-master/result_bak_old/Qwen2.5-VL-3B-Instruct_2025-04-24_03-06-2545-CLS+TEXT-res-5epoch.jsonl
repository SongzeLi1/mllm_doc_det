These artifacts are common in copy-move manipulations and occur due to imperfect blending of the copied section with the original background.\n\n2. **Lighting Inconsistency**:\n - The lighting on the tampered portion does not match the rest of the image. Differences in shadows and highlights indicate that the copied region was not originally part of the scene.\n\n3. **Perspective Relationships**:\n - The perspective of the tampered portion does not align perfectly with the rest of the dish.
